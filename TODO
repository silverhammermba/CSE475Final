fine-tune lock placement (hashmap_locking branch, insert fcn)
figure out effect of constants

replace unique_ptrs with normal pointers
remove useless iterators
add arg parsing for tests
fix all uint32_t conversions
make cfg iters total, not per-thread
use integer comparison for DPH thresh
make test run multiple attempts and report and average (maybe with variations?)
think about thread-safety/efficiency of RNG
maybe track size of fast lookup map rather than actually shrink it during rebuild
maybe keep collision map around
